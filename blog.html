            <h1 class="font-medium ">In JavaScript, the scope of variables declared with let, var, and const differs in terms of their visibility and accessibility within the program.The scope Of var, let and const discussed in below: </h1>
            <h1 class="font-medium mt-4">Var Scope: </h1>
            <p>var variables have function-level scope. This means they are visible throughout the entire function in which they are declared, but not outside of that function.</p>
            <p>If a var variable is declared outside of any function , it becomes a global variable, accessible from anywhere in our code.</p>
            <h1 class="font-medium mt-4">let Scope: </h1>
            <p>let variables have block-level scope. This means they are visible only within the block in which they are declared.</p>
            <p>let variables declared in the global scope are not attached to the global object, making them safer to use.</p>
            <h1 class="font-medium mt-4">const scope: </h1>
            <p>const variables also have block-level scope, just like let. They are visible only within the block in which they are declared.</p>
            <p>However, const variables cannot be reassigned after they are declared. Their values are constant.</p>

            <h1 class="font-medium ">null and undefined are two distinct values in JavaScript, and they have specific use cases..These are in the below: </h1>
            <h1 class="font-medium mt-4">null: </h1>
            <p>null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the intentional absence of any object value or a placeholder for an object that is expected to exist but hasn't been defined yet.</p>
            <p>You can explicitly set a variable or property to null to indicate that it has no meaningful value.</p>
            <h1 class="font-medium">Common use cases of null: </h1>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
                <li>Initializing variables or properties before they have a valid value.</li>
                <li>Indicating that a function or method didn't produce a valid result or found no matching element.</li>
                <li>As a way to clear references to objects, allowing them to be garbage-collected when they're no longer needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1 class="font-medium mt-4">undefined: </h1>
            <p>undefined is a value that represents the absence of a value or the uninitialized state of a variable or property.</p>
            <p>When you declare a variable or create an object property without assigning a value to it, it's automatically set to undefined.</p>
            <h1 class="font-medium">Common use cases of undefined: </h1>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
                <li>Variables or properties that have not been assigned a value yet.</li>
                <li>Function parameters that were not provided when calling a function.</li>
                <li>When accessing non-existent object properties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="font-medium ">REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing and interacting with web services. REST is not a technology itself but rather a style of designing networked applications.Discussion about API are in the below: </h1>
            <h1 class="font-medium text-2xl">The key principles and characteristics of a RESTful API include: </h1>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
                <li><span class="text-md font-bold">Statelessness: </span>Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not rely on any previous requests or session state stored on the server.</li>
                <li><span class="text-md font-bold">Client-Server Architecture:</span>The client and server should be separate entities, each with its own responsibilities. This separation allows for greater scalability and flexibility.</li>
                <li><span class="text-md font-bold">Uniform Interface: </span>REST APIs provide a consistent and uniform way of interacting with resources. This is typically achieved through the use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and standard conventions for resource URLs.</li>
                <li><span class="text-md font-bold">Resource-Based: </span>Resources are the key abstractions in a RESTful system. Resources are identified by URIs, and clients interact with these resources using standard HTTP methods.</li>
                <li><span class="text-md font-bold">Representation: </span>Resources can have multiple representations. Clients can request the representation that best suits their needs, and the server should respond with the appropriate representation.</li>
            </ul>
